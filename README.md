##  Overview

The project, named nginx-proxy, leverages Nginx as a key component for serving static content and load balancing in a web server cluster. By orchestrating multiple services through a Docker Compose file and utilizing Traefik labels, it enhances scalability and request handling efficiency. With a focus on distributing traffic across web servers and standardizing secure communication protocols, the project streamlines web application deployment and management. The inclusion of a responsive static website design demonstrates the project's commitment to showcasing diverse web server capabilities.
